# RaishasBookStore

I'm currently utilizing ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 5) to create a web application.
The application performs CRUD activities on a SQL Server database using Dependency Injection and Entity 
Framework Core.  This application's main objective is to enable customers to do large online book orders and 
get substantial savings. Users may connect in using a Facebook or Google account and place orders as either 
a business or an individual.  In addition to these features, I have a number of more features in the works.
I am committed to provide a top-notch, feature-rich application that satisfies the expectations of its 
consumers as a skilled ASP.NET expert.
