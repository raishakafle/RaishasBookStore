Went up to bootswatch.com, where I looked up for really cool themed templates for the project. 

I went up with the Theme "Flatly", then I went up to the roots folder > lib > bootstrap > dist > css. 

I updated the original bootstrap file to the name bootstrap_bk.css while I added a new bootstrap file to the folder.
