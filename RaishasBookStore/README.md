Back to working on the project..

Went up to bootswatch.com, where I looked up for really cool themed templates for the project. 

I went up with the Theme "Flatly", then I went up to the roots folder > lib > bootstrap > dist > css. 

I updated the original bootstrap file to the name bootstrap_bk.css while I added a new bootstrap file to the folder.

After I updated the older bootstrap file, and created a newer one. I made some changes in the Layout.cshtml file. I made changes inside header> nav with a new code that contained the bootstrap code and would work accordingly.

Then, I updated the site css file, and updated that with the newer css from the theme i chose Flatly.

I then made some changes in the color section to the header and footer in the Layout.cshtml page. I then committed and pushed all the files to GitHub 
and I am all set for now!
